# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on: [push]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  build:
    env:
      VALOR1: 'TEST'
      VALOR2: HOLA ${{ VALOR1 }}
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Runs a single command using the runners shell
    - name: Run a one-line script
      env:
        VALUES: ${{VALOR2}}
      run: |
        echo $VALOR2
        echo ${VALOR2}
        echo ${{VALOR2}}
        echo $VALUES
